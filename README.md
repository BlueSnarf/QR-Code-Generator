This is a simple QR Code Generator, it asks for your input with any url and then creates the qr code under the file name "totally_safe.png", 

You can edit the code to have it save under whatever file name you want. And by using img.(show), it will display in whatever your default image viewer is

Here's an example of the output (go ahead, scan it, I dare you)
